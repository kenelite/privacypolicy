# Privacy Policy — FlightLedger

**Last updated:** January 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how FlightLedger (“the App”, “we”) handles information when you use the FlightLedger iOS application. The App is designed with privacy in mind: we do not collect, transmit, or sell your personal data.

---

## 1. Summary

- **No personal data collection by us.** We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information to our servers.
- **No analytics or tracking.** The App does not include analytics, advertising, or third-party tracking.
- **Data stays on your device.** Flight data and app content are stored only on your iPhone or iPad (SwiftData).
- **No cloud sync by default.** The App does not include cloud sync, login, or server-side storage unless you or a distribution adds it (e.g. CloudKit).

---

## 2. Data Stored on Your Device

The App stores the following data **only on your device**:

- **Flight records:** Structured flight data you add via barcode scan, OCR (photo), or manual entry—for example departure and arrival airport codes (IATA), date, flight number, seat, and source (e.g. barcode vs OCR). By default, the App **does not** store raw scan or photograph images; only the extracted or entered flight information is persisted.
- **Scan artifacts (optional):** If the App saves a record of a scan, it may store only the recognized text (e.g. for batch OCR), not the original image, unless a future version or option explicitly stores images.
- **Airport reference data:** The App may load airport data from a bundled file (e.g. OurAirports CSV) into local storage to support search and map display; this data is not personal to you.
- **App state:** Preferences or in-app state used to display your flights in a list and on the map.

This data is **not** uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties in the default App. It remains under your control and is removed when you delete the App or its data.

---

## 3. Camera and Photo Access

- **Camera:** The App uses the **camera** only when you choose to scan a boarding pass barcode. Camera access is used solely to capture the barcode; we do not record or store video. You can revoke camera access at any time in **Settings → FlightLedger** (or **Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera**). Revoking access disables barcode scanning; manual entry and photo-based import are unaffected.
- **Photo library:** The App may access **photos or files** only when you choose to pick an image for OCR (e.g. a photo of a boarding pass or itinerary). Images are processed on-device for text recognition; by default the App does not save the original image, only the extracted flight information. You can revoke photo library access in **Settings → FlightLedger** (or **Settings → Privacy & Security → Photos**). Revoking access disables photo-based and batch image import; barcode scan and manual entry are unaffected.

We do not access your camera or photos without your action (e.g. tapping Scan or choosing an image).

---

## 4. Location

The App **does not** use your device’s GPS or collect your real-time location. The App uses only airport coordinates (e.g. from bundled airport data) to draw routes on the map and compute distances. No location data is sent to us or to third parties.

---

## 5. Network Use

The App may use the **internet** only in the following way:

- **Maps:** If you use the map view, the App may load map tiles (e.g. via Apple MapKit) to display flight routes. This is subject to Apple’s map services and their respective privacy terms. We do not receive or store the content of these requests.

The default App does not phone home to our servers, send analytics, crash reports, or usage data to us or to third parties, and does not include advertising or tracking SDKs.

---

## 6. No Account or Cloud Sync

The App does not require an account. There is no cloud sync, no login, and no server-side storage of your content in the default build. If you or a distribution adds cloud sync (e.g. iCloud/CloudKit), that would be described separately (e.g. in the App or its documentation).

---

## 7. Your Control and Data Deletion

- All App data is stored locally on your device. You can **delete individual flights** from the in-app list (swipe to delete) or from the flight detail screen (“Delete flight”).
- To delete **all** App data, remove the App from your device. We do not retain copies of your data because the default App does not send it to us.

---

## 8. Children’s Privacy

The App does not collect personal information from users. We do not knowingly collect data from children; the App is not directed at children and does not require age verification.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date at the top will be revised when changes are made. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy. For significant changes, we will provide notice (e.g. in the App or on the App’s web page) where feasible.

## 10. Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or the App’s handling of data, please contact us at the support or contact address provided in the App Store listing or on the App’s official website.
